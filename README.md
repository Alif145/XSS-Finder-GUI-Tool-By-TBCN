## 🚀 Hi, I'm Zerox-Uchicha! 👋
Hi Team Bd Cyber Ninja Offical CEO OR Admin We Make New XSS-BUG-Payload Injedction Auto Tool Of The World Our New tools . An XSS Finder Tool is a utility designed to help security professionals and penetration testers identify Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in web applications. These tools automate the process of detecting input fields and parameters that may be susceptible to XSS attacks by injecting various payloads and analyzing the responses.

# Features:

❗️Key Features of an XSS Finder Tool:❗️
Payload Injection – Automatically injects common XSS payloads (e.g., <script>alert(1)</script>, <img src=x onerror=alert(1)>) into input fields, URLs, and parameters.
Reflected & Stored XSS Detection – Checks for both reflected (immediate response-based) and stored (persistent) XSS vulnerabilities.
DOM-Based XSS Detection – Some advanced tools analyze JavaScript execution in the Document Object Model (DOM) to find client-side XSS.
Encoding & Obfuscation Support – Tests payloads with different encodings (e.g., URL, HTML, Unicode) to bypass filters.
False Positive Reduction – Validates findings to ensure they are exploitable and not just benign script tags.
Reporting – Generates reports detailing vulnerable endpoints, payloads used, and remediation steps.

Warning !📛 " This XSS_Payload Injection Tool is written for Students And Offical purposes. Any misuse of this tool is your responsibility Dont Copy Our Tool .."

1. Payload Injection
Purpose: Tests how the application processes untrusted input by injecting malicious scripts.
Mechanism:
Sends payloads like <script>alert(1)</script>, <svg onload=alert(1)>, or javascript:alert(1) into inputs (forms, URLs, headers).
Uses variations (e.g., uppercase, hex-encoded, or broken tags) to bypass weak filters.
Example (  <img src="x" onerror=prompt(1)>  )
If the payload executes, the site is vulnerable.
2. Reflected vs. Stored XSS Detection
Reflected XSS:
Payload appears in the immediate response (e.g., search results, error messages).
Detected by checking if injected input is echoed back unfiltered.
Stored XSS:
Payload is saved (e.g., in a database) and executed when other users view it (e.g., comments, profiles).
Tools simulate persistence by submitting payloads and revisiting pages to check for execution.
